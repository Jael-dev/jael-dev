### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like to learn again and again. In addition to learning, I like to share my knowledge. Attracted by mobile development in particular, I learned the dart language and the flutter framework. @Kolofap is the mobile project I'm most proud of right now.

In addition to mobile, I am currently learning Javascript and the vue js framework.

I am young and passionate, I learn quickly and I love what I do.
